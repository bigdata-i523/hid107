        This paper discuss the relationship between devops and big data applications
        and analytic. The investigation will focus on cloud platform devops , because
        the carrier for  most of big data application and analytic is cloud platform.
        Also, define the difficulty of implement devops is important for designing
        a big data application.

    abstract:  SQL database is the most usual database we use, the constitution of sql style database is easy for us to do data storage and search. According to the Artur's testing \cite{test:01}, he using many differences sql and nosql database to testing the insert performance for large amount of data(one million rows of randomized string) in the same time, and nosql databases always has best performance when insert large data. So when we need to deal with big data, SQL database is no longer handy for big data application. Even nosql database doesn't fit into every situation, but the mass data produce ability allow nosql database support most of big data applications and analytic.
