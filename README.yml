        This paper discuss the relationship between devops and big data applications
        and analytic. The investigation will focus on cloud platform devops , because
        the carrier for  most of big data application and analytic is cloud platform.
        Also, define the difficulty of implement devops is important for designing
        a big data application.

    abstract:  SQL database is the most usual database we use, the constitution of sql style database is easy for us to do data storage and search. According to the Artur's testing \cite{test:01}, he using many differences sql and nosql database to testing the insert performance for large amount of data(one million rows of randomized string) in the same time, and nosql databases always has best performance when insert large data. So when we need to deal with big data, SQL database is no longer handy for big data application. Even nosql database doesn't fit into every situation, but the mass data produce ability allow nosql database support most of big data applications and analytic.

    title: Big Data Analytics in Support Filtering Wrong Informations On Social Networking Sites
    abstract: In an era of information, people are more likely to get information from the ciber world.  Due to the conflict of interest,  many organizations hire  ``Spammers'' to post a mass of wrong comments under some famous person's post on Social Networking Sites for control the trend of public opinion\cite{abs:01}. So when user want to see the public opinion under some famous person's post, they usually get the wrong information which doesn't represent the real public opinion. Big Data analytic can provide information filtering to screening the fake comment based on data mining technique, and let the user be able to see the true of public opinion on social networking sites.
